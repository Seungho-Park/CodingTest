# 2270. Number of Ways to Split Array

## 문제설명
You are given a ```0-indexed``` integer array nums of length ```n```.

nums contains a valid split at index i if the following are true:

- The sum of the first ```i + 1``` elements is greater than or equal to the sum of the last ```n - i - 1``` elements.
- There is <b>at least one</b> element to the right of ```i```. That is, ```0 <= i < n - 1```.

Return the number of <b>valid splits</b> in nums.

## 제한사항
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- -10<sup>5</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>

## 예제
### Example 1:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: nums = [10,4,-8,7]
<b>Output</b>: 2
<b>Explanation:</b>
There are three ways of splitting nums into two non-empty parts:
- Split nums at index 0. Then, the first part is [10], and its sum is 10. The second part is [4,-8,7], and its sum is 3. Since 10 >= 3, i = 0 is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [10,4], and its sum is 14. The second part is [-8,7], and its sum is -1. Since 14 >= -1, i = 1 is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. Since 6 < 7, i = 2 is not a valid split.
Thus, the number of valid splits in nums is 2.
</pre>

### Example 2:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: nums = [2,3,1,0]
<b>Output</b>: 2
<b>Explanation:</b>
There are two valid splits in nums:
- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [2,3], and its sum is 5. The second part is [1,0], and its sum is 1. Since 5 >= 1, i = 1 is a valid split. 
- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [2,3,1], and its sum is 6. The second part is [0], and its sum is 0. Since 6 >= 0, i = 2 is a valid split.
</pre>


## 소스코드
```Swift
class Solution {
    func waysToSplitArray(_ nums: [Int]) -> Int {
        let total = nums.reduce(0, +)
        var count = 0
        var sum = 0

        for i in 0..<nums.count-1 {
            sum += nums[i]

            if sum >= total - sum {
                count += 1
            }
        }

        return count
    }
}
```

## 문제설명
Integer 배열 nums가 주어질 때, nums[0] ~ nums[i]까지의 합이 nums[i+1]~nums[nums.count-1] 까지의 합보다 크거나 같은 경우의 수를 구하는 문제.

처음 시작에 nums의 총 합을 구한 뒤 nums 배열을 돌며 왼쪽 합을 구하고, nums의 총 합에 왼쪽합을 뺀 값이 왼쪽 합의 값보다 작거나 같은지 카운트해서 해결.
