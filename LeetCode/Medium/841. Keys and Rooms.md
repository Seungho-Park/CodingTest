# 841. Keys and Rooms

## 문제설명
There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.

## 제한사항
- n == rooms.length
- 2 <= n <= 1000
- 0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000
- 1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000
- 0 <= rooms[i][j] < n
- All the values of rooms[i] are unique.

## 예제
### Example 1:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
<b>Output</b>: true
<b>Explanation:</b> 
We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
We then visit room 3.
Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.
</pre>

### Example 2:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
<b>Output</b>: false
<b>Explanation:</b> We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.
</pre>

```Swift
class Solution {
    func canVisitAllRooms(_ rooms: [[Int]]) -> Bool {
        var visitedRoom: [Bool] = .init(repeating: false, count: rooms.count)
        visitedRoom[0] = true

        var stack: [Int] = [0]

        while !stack.isEmpty {
            let room = stack.removeLast()

            for key in rooms[room] {
                if !visitedRoom[key] {
                    visitedRoom[key] = true
                    stack.append(key)
                }
            }
        }

        return !visitedRoom.contains(false)
    }
}
