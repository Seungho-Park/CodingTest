# 1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop

## 문제설명
You are given an integer array ```prices``` where ```prices[i]``` is the price of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> item in a shop.

There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to ```prices[j]``` where j is the minimum index such that ```j > i``` and ```prices[j] <= prices[i]```. Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an integer array ```answer``` where ```answer[i]``` is the final price you will pay for the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> item of the shop, considering the special discount.

## 제한사항
- ```1 <= prices.length <= 500```
- ```1 <= prices[i] <= 1000```

## 예제
### Example 1:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
<b>Output</b>: [4,2,4,2,3]
<b>Explanation</b>: 
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.
</pre>

### Example 2:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
<b>Output</b>: [1,2,3,4,5]
<b>Explanation</b>: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.
</pre>

### Example 3:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: prices = [10,1,1,6]
<b>Output</b>: [9,0,1,6]
</pre>


## 소스코드
```Swift
class Solution {
    func finalPrices(_ prices: [Int]) -> [Int] {
        var prices = prices

        for i in 0..<prices.count {
            for j in i+1..<prices.count {
                if prices[i] >= prices[j] {
                    prices[i] -= prices[j]
                    break
                }
            }
        }

        return prices
    }
}
```

## 문제설명
가격이 주어진 배열 prices가 있을 때 모든 배열을 반복하며 할인된 가격을 계산하여 반환하는 문제.

단, prices[i]를 할인하기 위한 조건으로는 prices[i]의 할인가격인 prices[j], j > i, prices[j] >= prices[i]여야 한다.

루프 반복으로 해결.
