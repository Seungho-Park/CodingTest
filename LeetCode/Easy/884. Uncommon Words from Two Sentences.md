# 884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences

## 문제설명
A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

## 제한사항
- 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 200
- s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters and spaces.
- s1 and s2 do not have leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in s1 and s2 are separated by a single space.

## 예제
### Example 1:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"
<b>Output</b>: ["sweet","sour"]
<b>Explanation</b>: 
The word "sweet" appears only in s1, while the word "sour" appears only in s2.
</pre>

### Example 2:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: "apple apple", s2 = "banana"
<b>Output</b>: ["banana"]
</pre>

## 소스코드
```Swift
class Solution {
    func uncommonFromSentences(_ s1: String, _ s2: String) -> [String] {
        var dict: [String: Int] = [:]

        for word in s1.split(separator: " ") {
            dict[String(word)] = (dict[String(word)] ?? 0) + 1
        }

        for word in s2.split(separator: " ") {
            dict[String(word)] = (dict[String(word)] ?? 0) + 1
        }

        return Array(dict.filter { $0.value == 1 }.keys)
    }
}
```

## 문제설명
문자열 s1, s2가 주어질 때, 두 문자열 모두에서 한 번만 나오는 문자 찾기 문제.
