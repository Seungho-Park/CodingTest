# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

## 문제설명
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

- -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
- 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
- 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).

Return the number that I picked.

## 제한사항
- 1 <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
- 1 <= pick <= n

## 예제
### Example 1:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: n = 10, pick = 6
<b>Output</b>: 6
</pre>

### Example 2:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: n = 1, pick = 1
<b>Output</b>: 1
</pre>

### Example 3:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: n = 2, pick = 1
<b>Output</b>: 1
</pre>

            case -1: end = mid
            case 1: start = mid + 1
            default: break
            }
        }

        return start
    }
