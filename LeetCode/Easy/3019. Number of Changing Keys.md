# 3019. Number of Changing Keys

## 문제설명
You are given a 0-indexed string s typed by a user. Changing a key is defined as using a key different from the last used key. For example, s = "ab" has a change of a key while s = "bBBb" does not have any.

Return the number of times the user had to change the key.

Note: Modifiers like shift or caps lock won't be counted in changing the key that is if a user typed the letter 'a' and then the letter 'A' then it will not be considered as a changing of key.

## 제한사항
- 1 <= words.length <= 50
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 10
- words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.

## 예제
### Example 1:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: s = "aAbBcC"
<b>Output</b>: 2
<b>Explanation</b>: 
From s[0] = 'a' to s[1] = 'A', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.
From s[1] = 'A' to s[2] = 'b', there is a change of key.
From s[2] = 'b' to s[3] = 'B', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.
From s[3] = 'B' to s[4] = 'c', there is a change of key.
From s[4] = 'c' to s[5] = 'C', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.
</pre>

### Example 2:
<pre>
<b>Input</b>: s = "AaAaAaaA"
<b>Output</b>: 0
<b>Explanation</b>: There is no change of key since only the letters 'a' and 'A' are pressed which does not require change of key.
</pre>

```Swift
class Solution {
    func countKeyChanges(_ s: String) -> Int {
        let s = Array(s.lowercased())
        var answer = 0

        for i in 1..<s.count {
            if s[i-1] != s[i] {
                answer += 1
            }
        }

        return answer
    }
}
```

## 문제설명
키가 바뀌는 상황의 수 (이전 문자랑 pair가 다른 상황)를 구하는 문제.

pair는 대소문자 차이라 전부 소문자로 바꾼 후 이전 문자랑 비교하며 다른 경우 +1 하는 식으로 해결.

시간복잡도 O(n)
